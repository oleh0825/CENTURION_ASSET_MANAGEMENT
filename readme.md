**Analogue** is a flexible, easy-to-use **ORM** for **PHP**. It is a transposition of the **Eloquent** ORM that ships with **Laravel** framework using a **Data Mapper** pattern instead of the original Active Record approach. it overcomes some of Eloquent's architectural limitations by using a strict separation of concerns; for example, you can use **Value Objects** or **Single-table-inheritance**, which are hard/impossible to implement correctly using the native ORM. 

As a **Laravel package**, it integrates flawlessly inside the framework, and provides a more powerfull peristance layer, allowing to build enterprise-grade applications while retaining a simple and enjoyable development experience. 

## Installation

```bash
composer require analogue/orm
```

See [Configuration](https://github.com/analogueorm/analogue/wiki/Installation) for more information.

## Concept

The concept is simple; your model layer is defined using 2 classes : one **Entity**, which can be any PHP class or extends the base *Analogue\ORM\Entity* class which provides magic getters and setters, and one **EntityMap** which defines relationships, castings, table name, database column names. 

Take this simple domain model : 

```php
use Analogue\ORM\Entity;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

class Blog extends Entity
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->posts = new Collection;
    }

    public function addPost(Post $post)
    {
        $this->posts->push($post);
    }
}

class Post extends Entity
{
 
}

```

We can instruct **Analogue** how these objects are related using these classes : 

```php
use Analogue\ORM\EntityMap;

class BlogMap extends EntityMap
{
    public function posts(Blog $blog)
    {
        return $this->hasMany($blog, Post::class);
    }
}

class PostMap extends EntityMap
{
    public function blog(Post $post)
    {
        return $this->belongsTo($post, Blog::class);
    }
}

```

Now we can create related instance of or object and persist them to the database : 

```php
$blog = new Blog;
$blog->title = "My first blog";

$post = new Post; 
$post->title->"My first post";

$blog->addPost($post);

// Only the blog instance need to explicitely stored; Analogue takes care of synchronizing
// related objects behinds the scene. 

mapper(Blog::class)->store($blog);

```

Once our objects are persisted into the database, we can query them using the fluent query builder : 

```php
$blog = mapper(Blog::class)->first();

echo $blog->posts->first()->title; // 'My first post'

```
